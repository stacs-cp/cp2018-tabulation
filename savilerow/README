To replicate experiments from CP 2018 paper:
Unpack this archive on a linux machine.

Install the fzn-chuffed executable in the path (Minion is included already).

Install GNU parallel.

Go into the experiments/short-tables-cp18/ directory

Do:
./makemodels-outer >log 2>error

This will start 32 processes and probably take several days to complete.

Results can be collected using ./collect-for-r in the same folder, and loaded into R and plotted using the analyse-collected-table.r script.

Results plotted in the paper are in the table-* files.
